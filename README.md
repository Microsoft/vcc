## Intro

VCC is a mechanical verifier for concurrent C programs. VCC takes a C program,
annotated with function specifications, data invariants, loop invariants, and
ghost code, and tries to prove these annotations correct. If it succeeds, VCC
promises that your program actually meets its specifications.

VCC was developed at the [Research in Software Engineering](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/rise/) 
group at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) in Redmond, WA and at the
European Microsoft Innovation Center in Aachen, Germany.

## Features

* VCC is **sound** -- if VCC verifies your program, it really is correct (modulo bugs in VCC itself).
* VCC verification is **modular** -- VCC verifies your program one function/type definition at a time, using only the specifications of the functions it calls and the data structures it uses. This means that you can verify your code even if the functions you call haven't been written yet.
* VCC supports **concurrency** -- you can use VCC to verify programs that use both coarse-grained and fine-grained concurrency. You can even use it to verify your concurrency control primitives. Verifying a function implicitly guarantees its thread safety in any concurrent environment that respects the contracts on its functions and data structures.
* VCC supports **low-level C** features (e.g. bitfields, unions, wrap-around arithmetic). 

## Getting Started

You get a taste of VCC by running it in your browser from 
[RiSE4Fun website](http://rise4fun.com/vcc). (Note however that this version is not
updated very often.)

To build VCC:
* Install Visual Studio Community 2015. Make sure to include F# language.
* Open `Vcc.sln` and build solution.
* You'll get `vcc.exe` and related binaries in `Vcc/Host/bin/Debug/`
